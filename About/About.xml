  <description>Provides a vastly more customizable work tab. 

&lt;size=24&gt;Important&lt;/size&gt;
Work Tab completely takes over job priorities from the vanilla game. In order to support core functionalities and other mods, it intercepts calls to get/set priorities. However, when it is told to set priorities by other sources - these sources are not aware of the time schedule, and the priority will be set for the whole day. As such, this mod is currently &lt;i&gt;incompatible&lt;/i&gt; with mods that dynamically change priorities (e.g. Force Pawn to do a Job).

&lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
Various usability extentions to the ‘vanilla’ work tab; 


Work types can be expanded to allow you to set priorities for the individual tasks within each work type. 
Time scheduler to set priorities for a given time slot only - allows you to designate a cleaning hour, or have your cook prepare meals right before dinner, etc. etc. 
Up to 9 priority levels (configurable)
Various small UX tweaks; scrolling to increase/decrease/toggle priorities, increase/decrease priorities for whole columns/rows.
All functions are detailed in the tooltips, take a moment to hover over and read them!

&lt;size=24&gt;Notes&lt;/size&gt;
With great power comes great responsibility. The default priorities of tasks within a job is set for a good reason; it’s (usually) a sensible default. Changing these can lead to deadlock situations, so change the priorities of individual jobs at your own risk! 

Finally, there will never be an ‘autolabour’ mode where a mod sets priorities for you. Due to the way the AI is handled (e.g. pawns actively look for work, instead of there being a ‘bulletin board’ of jobs that need doing), it’s not feasible to get the complete list of work that needs doing that would be needed to make this a reality, without extreme overhead and loads of special exception coding.
