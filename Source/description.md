Provides a vastly more customizable work tab. 

# Important
Work Tab completely takes over job priorities from the vanilla game. In order to support core functionalities and other mods, it intercepts calls to get/set priorities. However, when it is told to set priorities by other sources - these sources are not aware of the time schedule, and the priority will be set for the whole day. As such, this mod is currently *incompatible* with mods that dynamically change priorities (e.g. [Force Pawn to do a Job](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=937170538)).

# Features
Various usability extentions to the 'vanilla' work tab; 
 - Work types can be expanded to allow you to set priorities for the individual tasks within each work type. 
 - Time scheduler to set priorities for a given time slot only - allows you to designate a cleaning hour, or have your cook prepare meals right before dinner, etc. etc. 
 - Up to 9 priority levels (configurable)
 - Various small UX tweaks; scrolling to increase/decrease/toggle priorities, increase/decrease priorities for whole columns/rows.
 - All functions are detailed in the tooltips, take a moment to hover over and read them!

# Notes
With great power comes great responsibility. The default priorities of tasks within a job is set for a good reason; it's (usually) a sensible default. Changing these can lead to deadlock situations, so change the priorities of individual jobs at your own risk! 

Finally, there will never be an 'autolabour' mode where a mod sets priorities for you. Due to the way the AI is handled (e.g. pawns actively look for work, instead of there being a 'bulletin board' of jobs that need doing), it's not feasible to get the complete list of work that needs doing that would be needed to make this a reality, without extreme overhead and loads of special exception coding.
